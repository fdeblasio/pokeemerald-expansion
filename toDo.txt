## Known Bugs
- When using items, the text box will be empty at the end. This is caused by some of the code changes from speeding up the text
- Items in the Battle Pyramid's Battle Bag/held items in the Battle Pike are turning into Poke Balls
    - Seems to happen after trainer battles?
    - This occurs even with the Battle Frontier changes reverted

## Second, more advanced run (1.3.0)
- Stay on EVs/IVs when switching Pokemon
- If Flash is unused, remove it from being an option in the summary screen
- Edit moves that work in field
    - Maybe edit so instead of "if has move" to "if can learn move" (might not be simple since it's .inc and not C)
    - Cut:
        - Slash?
        - Fury Swipes?
        - Crush Claw?
        - Dragon Claw?
        - X-Scissor
        - Aqua Cutter
        - Psycho Cut
        - Moves boosted by Sharpness
    - Rock Smash:
        - Brick Break
        - Meteor Mash?
        - Focus Punch?
    - Strength:
        - Superpower?
        - Close Combat?
- Expand moves usable in overworld (see above)
    - Alternatively, remove instances of trees, rocks, boulders, etc
        - Would need to figure out Rusturf
    - Would need to double check but this should make Cut, Rock Smash, and Strength forgettable
        - (sHMMoves and IsMoveHM)
        - edit tm_hms.h
    - Trick House can still use them but maybe have Escape Rope usable there
- Turn HMs into TMs if they are no longer used in the field
    - Remove them from being an option in the summary screen (party_menu.c enum)
    - Remove release blocks in pokemon_storage_system.c
    - Look for FIELD_MOVE_X
    - Currently are in same index spot. Should be moved to before HMs once everything is figured out (can simplify IsMoveHM once done)
    - Edit text (Steven's house for Dive for example)
- Add in Houndoom for more Magma variety
    - Mega Evolve Tabitha's?
    - Redo Admin/Maxie teams
    - Update some grunts to have it 
        - Slugma/Vulpix Mossdeep grunt has Slugma replaced by Houndour, the Mightyena grunt gets replaced with a Magcargo, and one of the Numel grunts gets Mightyena
    - Update some Flannery trainers
    - Update some Kindlers
- More save space editing
    - Medicine Pocket?
    - See if it's possible to give item PC and decoration PC have more room
- See if only some bag pockets can show up during battle (Key Items aren't needed in battle, for example)
- Include charms?
- Remove all PP Ups/Maxes (including Pickup) due to moves having max PP by default
Double-check Mirage Island
Combine changes and README?
    Include more changes, even if general like Battle Frontier edits
Battle Frontier
    - Make pausing challenge not a soft save (CHALLENGE_STATUS_SAVING)
    - Update rest of apprentice teams

- https://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=10167016&postcount=83

- Edit Slot odds (SLOT_MACHINE_)? Even though there's only three prizes?
- Add Hyper Training
- Once Mints are implemented, in Lilycove 3F, move X items to left clerk and make right clerk Mints
    - Or move Mints to left too and have left be Chansey, right be Delibird
- Get rid of low health constant beeping (https://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=10246778&postcount=194)

- Implement Pokedex Plus (https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=441996)
- Figure out ?????? showing up at end of Dex
- DON'T USE DEBUG MENU FOR FLYING. Test to see if without it, Fly Flags are set correctly
    - Maybe use makeshift version of it (without setting all flags) in Start menu to Fly without needing a Pokemon who knows it (no badge requirements)
        - Fly to routes?
- Make list of all Magma/Aqua Pokemon and make them spread more evenly across the Grunts
    - Maybe Admins rely less on Mightyena/Leaders' signature
    - Magma: Numel, Slugma, Vulpix, Houndour, Torkoal, Baltoy, ???
    - Aqua: Carvanha, Tentacool, ???
    - Both: Poochyena/Zubat?
- Add Farigiraf to Hoenn Dex once implemented
- Add Ice Spinner as a TM (and maybe give to Beartic/Mamoswine/other Ice types) once implemented?
- Add 3 other Regis?
    - Add Regigigas to Sealed Chamber?
    - Regieleki near New Mauville?
    - Regidrago near Meteor Falls?
- Diversify water routes instead of just Tentacool/Wingull (definitely add more Carvanha; bring some fishing encounters to Surf)
- Figure out a way to mass update of both level up and teachable moves (PoryMoves has slightly different syntax for some forms)
- Spruce up battles/rematches
    - Have each rematch only be possible after certain badges? Would make rematch levels more consistent
    - customAll Pokemon
        - Winston could have a shiny
            - Maybe all Rich Boys/Ladies have shinies (would need to have different Pokemon from each other instead of all having Zigzagoon)
        - Calvin could have a good Nature/EV
        - Leaders would have optimal Abilities/EVs/IVs/Natures
    - Winston's rich enough to buy TMs so his moveset should incorporate that once TMs are finalized
        - Gym Leader rematches should also utilize TMs
    - Breeders should have good IVs/Natures/Abilities
    - Triathlete would be Speed-focused (maybe endurance/HP too)
    - Winstrates (including Victor) should have EVs due to the mom mentioning using the Macho Brace
    - Tori and Tia should have Spindas that aren't identical
    - Fix Roxanne's rematches being male (due to double battles (which the rematches are) having the personality set before the gender. Can rearrange steps or use customAll to manually set gender)
    - Fix Flannery's rematches being male; also her Torkoal or Ninetales should have Drought
    - Norman can have Toxic Orb Toxic Boost Zangoose
        - Spinda: Thrash if Own Tempo, Superpower if Contrary. Should be given a cool pattern (maybe 88888888?)
    - Fix Winona's rematches being male; Pelipper gets Drizzle?
    - Gym leaders/Steven/Breeders can have Hidden Abilities
    - Maxie/Archie/Steven use Mega Evolutions
    - Aqua Leaders' signatures hold Deep Sea items (need to find equivalent for Magma)
    - Vito can use TMs
        - Swap Vito with Ace Trainer on 1F near the end?
- Figure out why PokeNav callers think there were 512 wins at the Battle Palace
    - Might be related to Battle Tent giving an item right away
- Check that Mossdeep swimmer flag works
- In game trades
- Map out progression of low/medium/high power moves for each type/move type and improve level up movesets for more STAB
- Bring important Trainers up to ORAS levels?
- Magmortar Flash Fire?
- Cherrim
- Find way to get Hypnosis to always hit if Hypno is using it?
- Make Water Veil also up evasion like Sand Veil?
- Edit max money
- Should be able to run from wild Pokemon if it is Digging, Diving, Flying, Bouncing, etc
    - Even if ability is Shadow Tag/Arena Trap
- Actually go through SS Tidal now that you'll have more bag space
- Brendan/May/Steven rematches?
- Add Pokemon with dolls? (Togepi, Smoochum, Clefairy, Lapras, Snorlax, Venusaur, Charizard, Blastoise)

    - Pokemon
        - EVs
        - Moves
    - Give BP after every battle?
    - Do better with saving/resting

    - See if Poke Ball issue no longer occurs on a clean save
    - Edit Battle Frontier messages for Fairy?
    - Add new Pokemon to Frontier mons?
    - Make teams more accurate to trainer classes?
    - Make resting not a soft save (CHALLENGE_STATUS_SAVING)
    - Make retiring not reset streak
        - Perhaps combine the two to take a pause like in SwSh
    - Battle Tower
        - Apprentices
    - Battle Factory
        - Add new moves to moveStyles (sRequiredMoveCounts)
        - Don't have both Open Level and Level 50 since the Pokemon are rentals anyways?

### Big changes from Vanilla - low priority
- Remove IVs? Maybe make boolean for either 0 or 31 added to stat
    - Would need to figure out Hidden Power
- Fire Blast/Hydro Pump/Stone Edge accurate in respective weathers?
    - Make Thunder also accurate in Electric Terrain?
- Calculate Electro Ball more similarly to Gyro Ball?
- Add in Hoenn Dex regionals?
    - Sun/Shiny Stone for Alolan Raichu
    - Alolan Sandshrew/Vulpix at Shoal Cave
    - Alolan Muk
    - Shiny/Dawn Stone for Galarian Weezing

    - Sandslash, Ninetales, Cursola, and maybe Obstagoon can be used to diversify the Elite Four teams

## Future hacks
All Yellow Pokémon with yellow shinies (Lickitung, Altaria, etc) replacing the regular palette
