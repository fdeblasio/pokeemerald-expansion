        - Winston could have a shiny
        - Calvin could have a good Nature/EV
        - Leaders would have optimal Abilities/EVs/IVs/Natures
    - Winston's rich enough to buy TMs so his moveset should incorporate that once TMs are finalized
        - Gym Leader rematches should also utilize TMs
    - Breeders should have good IVs/Natures/Abilities
    - Triathlete would be Speed-focused (maybe endurance/HP too)

- Expand bag
- Try to find Bolts foreground of Walda PC
- Implement Mega Evolution (Mega Manectric for Wattson rematches)
    - Maxie/Archie teams
    - Primal legendaries in story (holding their orbs)

- Implement Deoxys encounter at island/changing forms at Fallarbor
- Replace Regis with their doll sprites since they look more like them?
- Give Espeon Power Gem on level up
- Edit Slot odds (SLOT_MACHINE_)? Even though there's only three prizes?
- Make the rapids easier to navigate?
- Poison Heal is in the game so add Toxic Orb (Lilycove?)
- Update Deep Sea items to work on respective evolutions as well?
- Rework land_mons to only have 10 slots? (last two would go from 4->5)?
    - Rework fishing to have one less slot (Super Rod 4/1->5)?
- Incorporate new items/new methods of obtaining them (like how PP Ups are sold in Chansey Supply or Bottle Caps in Delibird)
    - Lilycove

    - Make Linking Cord available in shop
    - Lilycove: Turn one 4th floor clerk into all missing TMs, the other into evolution items

- Maybe do one run-through of small updates and then add in new items/updated teams in a second runthrough?
    - When doing new savefile, remove `u32 tmShopFlags[4];` from include/global.h
    - Maybe this is when the bag expansion happens
