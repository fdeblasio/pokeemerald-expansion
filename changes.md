In college, I had you list some of your favorite Pokémon and told you I'd make you a FireRed hack. It never happened, but now hacking has come a long way, although with Emerald getting the improvements. There are some challenges this provides due to it having more of a plot, but I think I made it work.








- Wild Pokémon and Trainers have their levels increased to make grinding less of a pain
    - However, with the Exp Share now affecting all party members, this can lead to becoming overleveled
- Decapitalization
- Shiny Pokémon can no longer spawn until you get Poké Balls
- Some areas made easier to navigate
    - Route 102/103: Path from Littleroot to rival is more direct
- Safari Zone has been removed
- Pokémon have a more even encounter distribution
- Cut, Fly, Strength, Flash, Rock Smash, and Dive can now be forgotten
    - Fly can now be used from the Start Menu after getting Mauville's badge
    - Cut, Strength, and Rock Smash no longer need a badge to be used
    - Cut trees have been removed from everywhere but the Trick House
    - Strength boulders have been removed from everywhere but the Trick House and an optional puzzle in Seafloor Cavern
    - Rock Smash rocks have been removed from everywhere but Rusturf Tunnel. Brick Break can now also break them
    - The Escape Rope can by used in the Trick Room puzzles that involve Cut/Strength
    - Flash is no longer needed anywhere

    - The Weather Institute on Route 119
    - Mt. Pyre on Route 122
    - Sky Pillar on Route 131
    - Southern Island
- Berry trees give more berries
- Sealed Chamber still needs to be completed to open the Regi areas, but it's solved by simply pressing A in the inner room
    - The door to Sealed Chamber and the Regis' inner rooms are now automatically open
- Made rapids easier to navigate so that only one trip is needed to get all items/battle all trainers (at the cost of looking slightly worse)
- All moves automatically have their max PP amount
- Sacred Ash now works in battles although it only revives one Pokémon

- Frontier Brains have updated teams
- Battle Pyramid wild Pokémon have been updated
- Pokémon can now be listed as orange in the Pokédex
- Underwater areas now connect better
- Mirage Island now appears every other day

- Tickets for islands where Latios, Latias, and Deoxys reside are given after beating the Elite Four
    - Latios and Latias no longer roam and instead both show up on Southern Island
    - The Deoxys puzzle is much simpler
- Battle Frontier no longer requires saving
- SS Tidal trainers can be rebattled every trip
- You can now run from wild Pokémon if they are asleep, frozen, or in a semi-invulnerable state (using Fly, Dig, Dive, Bounce, etc.). This works even if they have Shadow Tag/Arena Trap
- Pokémon in the Battle Frontier/Trainer Hill now register in the Pokédex
