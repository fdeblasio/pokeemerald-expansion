## Rebasing
upcoming
└─ textDecapitalization
   └─ develop
      └─ All hacks

## Known Bugs
- When using items, the text box will be empty at the end. This is caused by some of the code changes from speeding up the text
- Items in the Battle Pyramid's Battle Bag/held items in the Battle Pike are turning into Poke Balls
    - Seems to happen after trainer battles?
    - This occurs even with the Battle Frontier changes reverted
- AI_FLAG_ACE_POKEMON didn't seem to work for Roxanne but may for Brawly
- Unburden may not work?

## To Do:
- Stay on EVs/IVs when switching Pokemon
- Edit moves that work in field
    - Maybe edit so instead of "if has move" to "if can learn move" (might not be simple since it's .inc and not C)
    - Cut:
        - Moves boosted by Sharpness
    - Strength:
        - Superpower?
        - Close Combat?
- Alternatively, remove instances of rocks, boulders, etc
    - Cut is still usable in the Trick House
    - Strength is still usable in the Trick House and Seafloor Cavern
    - Rock Smash is still usable in Rusturf Tunnel
- Add in Houndoom for more Magma variety
    - Mega Evolve Tabitha's?
    - Redo Admin/Maxie teams
    - Update some grunts to have it 
        - Slugma/Vulpix Mossdeep grunt has Slugma replaced by Houndour, the Mightyena grunt gets replaced with a Magcargo, and one of the Numel grunts gets Mightyena
    - Update some Flannery trainers
    - Update some Kindlers
- More save space editing
    - Medicine Pocket?
    - See if it's possible to give item PC and decoration PC have more room
- See if only some bag pockets can show up during battle (Key Items aren't needed in battle, for example)
- Include charms?
- Remove all PP Ups/Maxes (including Pickup) due to moves having max PP by default
Double-check Mirage Island
Combine changes and README?
    Include more changes, even if general like Battle Frontier edits
Battle Frontier
    - Make pausing challenge not a soft save (CHALLENGE_STATUS_SAVING)

- https://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=10167016&postcount=83
- Overworld sprites to match trainer sprites (for example, giving Youngsters yellow shirts, girl tubers a yellow tube, Rangers red clothes, Dragon Tamers capes and correct hair color)
- Improve Pokemon overworld sprites
- Try to find Bolts foreground of Walda PC
- Some MAN_2's maybe could be switched to DEVON_EMPLOYEE
- Debug menu improvements
- Battle Tent Pokemon/EVs?
- Edit friendship evolution methods
- Get all the weird Mauville men at once?
- Update Favor Lady's items to include new items
- Implement Deoxys encounter at island/changing forms at Fallarbor
- Give Espeon Power Gem on level up or evolution?
- Edit Slot odds (SLOT_MACHINE_)? Even though there's only three prizes?
- Add Hyper Training
- Once Mints are implemented, in Lilycove 3F, move X items to left clerk and make right clerk Mints
    - Or move Mints to left too and have left be Chansey, right be Delibird
- Get rid of low health constant beeping (https://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=10246778&postcount=194)
- Elite Four rematches

- PC in menu (look at debug menu)
- TM Case?
- Get PokeNav to work indoors?
- Edit rest out mass outbreaks
    - Maractus/Sandile in Route 111? Would be first time expanding past Gens 1-3 + evos
- Edit contests?
- Stop daycare from deleting moves
- Add relearning moves to PC?
- Remove unused code
- Pokemon in Frontier/Trainer Hill should be registered in Dex
- Update Shiftry's Hidden Ability to Wind Rider
- Implement Pokedex Plus (https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=441996)
- Figure out ?????? showing up at end of Dex
- DON'T USE DEBUG MENU FOR FLYING. Test to see if without it, Fly Flags are set correctly
    - Maybe use makeshift version of it (without setting all flags) in Start menu to Fly without needing a Pokemon who knows it (no badge requirements)
        - Fly to routes?
- Make list of all Magma/Aqua Pokemon and make them spread more evenly across the Grunts
    - Maybe Admins rely less on Mightyena/Leaders' signature
    - Magma: Numel, Slugma, Vulpix, Houndour, Torkoal, Baltoy, ???
    - Aqua: Carvanha, Tentacool, ???
    - Both: Poochyena/Zubat?
- Add Farigiraf to Hoenn Dex once implemented
- Add Ice Spinner as a TM (and maybe give to Beartic/Mamoswine/other Ice types) once implemented?
- Add 3 other Regis?
    - Add Regigigas to Sealed Chamber?
    - Regieleki near New Mauville?
    - Regidrago near Meteor Falls?
- Diversify water routes instead of just Tentacool/Wingull (definitely add more Carvanha; bring some fishing encounters to Surf)
- Figure out a way to mass update of both level up and teachable moves (PoryMoves has slightly different syntax for some forms)
- Spruce up battles/rematches
    - Have each rematch only be possible after certain badges? Would make rematch levels more consistent
    - customAll Pokemon
        - Winston could have a shiny
            - Maybe all Rich Boys/Ladies have shinies (would need to have different Pokemon from each other instead of all having Zigzagoon)
        - Calvin could have a good Nature/EV
        - Leaders would have optimal Abilities/EVs/IVs/Natures
    - Breeders should have good IVs/Natures/Abilities
    - Triathlete would be Speed-focused (maybe endurance/HP too)
    - Winstrates (including Victor) should have EVs due to the mom mentioning using the Macho Brace
    - Tori and Tia should have Spindas that aren't identical
    - Fix Roxanne's rematches being male (due to double battles (which the rematches are) having the personality set before the gender. Can rearrange steps or use customAll to manually set gender)
    - Fix Flannery's rematches being male; also her Torkoal or Ninetales should have Drought
    - Norman can have Toxic Orb Toxic Boost Zangoose
        - Spinda: Thrash if Own Tempo, Superpower if Contrary. Should be given a cool pattern (maybe 88888888?)
    - Fix Winona's rematches being male; Pelipper gets Drizzle?
    - Gym leaders/Steven/Breeders can have Hidden Abilities
    - Maxie/Archie/Steven use Mega Evolutions
    - Aqua Leaders' signatures hold Deep Sea items (need to find equivalent for Magma)
    - Vito can use TMs
        - Swap Vito with Ace Trainer on 1F near the end?
- Figure out why PokeNav callers think there were 512 wins at the Battle Palace
    - Might be related to Battle Tent giving an item right away
- Check that Mossdeep swimmer flag works
- In game trades
- Map out progression of low/medium/high power moves for each type/move type and improve level up movesets for more STAB
- Bring important Trainers up to ORAS levels?
- Magmortar Flash Fire?
- Cherrim
- Find way to get Hypnosis to always hit if Hypno is using it?
- Make Water Veil also up evasion like Sand Veil?
- Edit max money
- Should be able to run from wild Pokemon if it is Digging, Diving, Flying, Bouncing, etc
    - Even if ability is Shadow Tag/Arena Trap
- Actually go through SS Tidal now that you'll have more bag space
- Brendan/May/Steven rematches?
- Add Pokemon with dolls? (Togepi, Smoochum, Clefairy, Lapras, Snorlax, Venusaur, Charizard, Blastoise)
- Make seperate Dex for post-game (similar to SwSh DLC dexes)?
- Give Absol/Ceruledge Sharpness?
- Add FRLG trainer sprites/overworld sprites
    - Sprites are added but still need to be implemented. Overworld sprites may have duplicates for Pokemon and may need palettes
- Make inserting trainer sprites easier?
    - Wrapper for src/data/graphics/trainers.h?
- Contests overhaul
- Frontier overhaul:
    - Pokemon
        - EVs
        - Moves
    - Give BP after every battle?
    - Do better with saving/resting
    - Remove level 50? Or remove Open Level but lower Pokemon to level 50 if over?
    - See if Poke Ball issue no longer occurs on a clean save
    - Edit Battle Frontier messages for Fairy?
    - Add new Pokemon to Frontier mons?
    - Make teams more accurate to trainer classes?

    - Battle Tower
        - Apprentices
    - Battle Factory
        - Add new moves to moveStyles (sRequiredMoveCounts)
        - Don't have both Open Level and Level 50 since the Pokemon are rentals anyways?

### Big changes from Vanilla - low priority
- Remove IVs? Maybe make boolean for either 0 or 31 added to stat
    - Would need to figure out Hidden Power
- Fire Blast/Hydro Pump/Stone Edge accurate in respective weathers?
    - Make Thunder also accurate in Electric Terrain?
- Calculate Electro Ball more similarly to Gyro Ball?
- Add in Hoenn Dex regionals?
    - Sun/Shiny Stone for Alolan Raichu

    - Alolan Muk

    - Sandslash, Ninetales, Cursola, and maybe Obstagoon can be used to diversify the Elite Four teams

## Future hacks
All Yellow Pokémon with yellow shinies (Lickitung, Altaria, etc) replacing the regular palette
