## To Do
- https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=416647&page=1
- https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/wiki/Tutorials
- Look at new animations for moves (in battle.h)
- Change Day/Night hours?
    - Set proper time hours (instead of all AM being morning and all PM being night)
- Gallade Sharpness (maybe wait for master/upcoming update)
- Make Latios/Latias easier to catch/not roam?
    - Maybe get rid of roamers and add both Latis to the Island?
- Overworld sprites to match trainer sprites (for example, giving Youngsters yellow shirts, girl tubers a yellow tube, and Rangers red clothes)
- Try to find Bolts foreground of Walda PC
- Some MAN_2's maybe could be switched to DEVON_EMPLOYEE
- Debug menu improvements
- Stay on EVs/IVs when switching Pokemon
- Battle Tent Pokemon/EVs?
- Edit friendship evolution methods
- Get all the weird Mauville men at once?
- Update Favor Lady's items to include new items
- See if only some bag pockets can show up during battle (Key Items aren't needed in battle, for example)
- Figure out if it's possible to select multiple Pokemon when moving to or from party
- Implement Deoxys encounter at island/changing forms at Fallarbor
- Replace Regis with their doll sprites since they look more like them?
- Give Espeon Power Gem on level up or evolution
- Edit Slot odds (SLOT_MACHINE_)? Even though there's only three prizes?
- Update Deep Sea items to work on respective evolutions as well?
- Add Hyper Training
- Primal legendaries in story (holding their orbs)
- Once Mints are implemented, in Lilycove 3F, move X items to left clerk and make right clerk Mints
    - Or move Mints to left too and have left be Chansey, right be Delibird
- Add Snowscape to Snorunt line's level up set once upcoming is merged in
- Get rid of low health constant beeping
- If Flash is unused, remove it from being an option in the summary screen
- Elite Four rematches
- Add Ampharosite to Battle Frontier store
- Replace ifdefs for move stats with just one set of stats
- Add EXP Candy
- Use location pointer for Mirage Island?

- Second, more advanced run:
    - Edit moves that work in field
        - Maybe edit so instead of "if has move" to "if can learn move" (might not be simple since it's .inc and not C)
        - Cut:
            - Slash?
            - Fury Swipes?
            - Crush Claw?
            - Dragon Claw?
            - X-Scissor
            - Aqua Cutter
            - Psycho Cut
        - Rock Smash:
            - Brick Break
            - Meteor Mash?
            - Focus Punch?
        - Strength:
            - Superpower?
            - Close Combat?
        - Fly:
            - Notes:
                - Is manual unlike the rest so would need to be added to the Fly edit
            - Teleport? (Would need to remove existing functionality)
            - ExtremeSpeed?
    - Expand moves usable in overworld (see above)
        - Alternatively, remove instances of trees, rocks, boulders, etc
        - Would need to double check but this should make Cut, Rock Smash, and Strength forgettable
            - (sHMMoves and IsMoveHm)
        - Trick House can still use them but maybe have Escape Rope usable there
    - Turn HMs into TMs if they are no longer used in the field
        - Remove them from being an option in the summary screen
        - Remove release blocks in pokemon_storage_system.c
        - Look for FIELD_MOVE_X
        - Currently are in same index spot. Should be moved to before HMs once everything is figured out (can simplify IsMoveHm once done)
        - Edit text (Steven's house for Dive for example)
    - When doing new savefile, remove `u32 tmShopFlags[4];` from include/global.h
    - Expand Bag!!!
    - Implement Pokedex Plus (https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=441996)
    - Figure out ?????? showing up at end of Dex
    - Revamp EVs to give 1 stat per EV and cap out at 63
    - Calculate Electro Ball more similarly to Gyro Ball?
    - DON'T USE DEBUG MENU FOR FLYING. Test to see if without it, Fly Flags are set correctly
        - Maybe use makeshift version of it (without setting all flags) to Fly without needing a Pokemon who knows it
    - Add in Houndoom for more Magma variety?
        - Replace Magcargo as Tabitha's main Pokemon (currently unsure if it will Mega Evolve)
        - Add in Hoenn Dex after Rhyperior
        - Add Houndoomite to Lilycove Shop
        - Update some grunts to have it 
            - Slugma/Vulpix Mossdeep grunt has Slugma replaced by Houndour, the Mightyena grunt gets replaced with a Magcargo, and one of the Numel grunts gets Mightyena
        - Update some Flannery trainers
        - Update some Kindlers
    - Make list of all Magma/Aqua Pokemon and make them spread more evenly across the Grunts
    - Add in Hoenn Dex regionals? (Sun/Shiny Stone for Alolan Raichu/Alolan Sandshrew/Vulpix at Shoal Cave, Shiny/Dawn Stone for Galarian Weezing/level 38 Galarian Corsola)
    - Add Farigiraf to Hoenn Dex once implemented
    - Add 3 other Regis?
        - Add Regigigas to Sealed Chamber?
        - Regieleki near New Mauville?
        - Regidrago near Meteor Falls?
    - Diversify water routes instead of just Tentacool/Wingull (definitely add more Carvanha; bring some fishing encounters to Surf)
    - Go back and make rematch levels stronger/more consistent
    - Rework land_mons to only have 10 slots? (last two would go from 4->5)?
    - Spruce up battles/rematches
        - customAll Pokemon
            - Winston could have a shiny
                - Maybe all Rich Boys/Ladies have shinies (would need to have different Pokemon from each other instead of all having Zigzagoon)
            - Calvin could have a good Nature/EV
            - Leaders would have optimal Abilities/EVs/IVs/Natures
        - Winston's rich enough to buy TMs so his moveset should incorporate that once TMs are finalized
            - Gym Leader rematches should also utilize TMs
        - Breeders should have good IVs/Natures/Abilities
        - Triathlete would be Speed-focused (maybe endurance/HP too)
        - Winstrates (including Victor) should have EVs due to the mom mentioning using the Macho Brace
        - Tori and Tia should have Spindas that aren't identical
        - Fix Roxanne's rematches being male (due to double battles (which the rematches are) having the personality set before the gender. Can rearrange steps or use customAll to manually set gender)
        - Fix Flannery's rematches being male; also her Torkoal or Ninetales should have Drought
        - Norman can have Toxic Orb Toxic Boost Zangoose
            - Spinda: Thrash if Own Tempo, Superpower if Contrary. Should be given a cool pattern (maybe 88888888?)
        - Fix Winona's rematches being male; Pelipper gets Drizzle
        - Gym leaders/Steven/Breeders can have Hidden Abilities
        - Maxie/Archie/Steven use Mega Evolutions
    - Figure out why PokeNav callers think there were 512 wins at the Battle Palace
    - Check that Mossdeep swimmer flag works

Abandoned Ship Dive section
    Since Deep Sea items can be bought, should a Big Pearl/Pearl String be given instead?
