## Known Bugs
- Due to the increased walking speed, followers will sometimes clip through tiles
- When using items, the text box will be empty at the end. This is caused by some of the code changes from speeding up the text
- AI_FLAG_ACE_POKEMON doesn't seem to work
- HGSS Pokédex shows evolutions multiple times (for this branch, only effects stone/location evos)
- If you help one of the Lilycove Pokémon Center ladies, the other lady thinks you've already helped her as well

### Potentially just savefile issues due to playing while hacking
- Items in the Battle Pyramid's Battle Bag/held items in the Battle Pike are turning into Poke Balls
    - Seems to happen after trainer battles?
    - This occurs even with the Battle Frontier changes reverted
- Verdanturf Battle Tent sometimes gives an item right away
- PokéNav callers sometimes think there were 512 wins at the Battle Palace (seems to be related to Battle Tent issue)
