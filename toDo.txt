## To Do
- https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=416647&page=1
- https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/wiki/Tutorials
- Look at new animations for moves (in battle.h)
- Gallade Sharpness (maybe wait for master/upcoming update)
- Overworld sprites to match trainer sprites (for example, giving Youngsters yellow shirts, girl tubers a yellow tube, Rangers red clothes, Dragon Tamers capes and correct hair color)
- Improve Pokemon overworld sprites
- Try to find Bolts foreground of Walda PC
- Some MAN_2's maybe could be switched to DEVON_EMPLOYEE
- Debug menu improvements
- Stay on EVs/IVs when switching Pokemon
- Battle Tent Pokemon/EVs?
- Edit friendship evolution methods
- Get all the weird Mauville men at once?
- Update Favor Lady's items to include new items
- See if only some bag pockets can show up during battle (Key Items aren't needed in battle, for example)
- Implement Deoxys encounter at island/changing forms at Fallarbor
- Give Espeon Power Gem on level up or evolution
- Edit Slot odds (SLOT_MACHINE_)? Even though there's only three prizes?
- Add Hyper Training
- Once Mints are implemented, in Lilycove 3F, move X items to left clerk and make right clerk Mints
    - Or move Mints to left too and have left be Chansey, right be Delibird
- Add Snowscape to Snorunt line's level up set once upcoming is merged in
- Get rid of low health constant beeping
- If Flash is unused, remove it from being an option in the summary screen
- Elite Four rematches
- Add Ampharosite to Battle Frontier store
- Replace ifdefs for move stats with just one set of stats
- Add EXP Candy
- Use location pointer for Mirage Island?
- Improve B-canceling moves
- Figure out how to get important trainers to use their best Pokemon last
    - AI_FLAG_ACE_POKEMON
- Go back and make rematch levels stronger/more consistent
- Type effectiveness in battle
- PC in menu (look at debug menu)
- TM Case?
- Get PokeNav to work indoors?
- Have Hoenn starters learn STAB move at level 6 to make first rival battle easier
- Edit rest out mass outbreaks
    - Maractus/Sandile in Route 111? Would be first time expanding past Gens 1-3 + evos

- Second, more advanced run:
    - Edit moves that work in field
        - Maybe edit so instead of "if has move" to "if can learn move" (might not be simple since it's .inc and not C)
        - Cut:
            - Slash?
            - Fury Swipes?
            - Crush Claw?
            - Dragon Claw?
            - X-Scissor
            - Aqua Cutter
            - Psycho Cut
        - Rock Smash:
            - Brick Break
            - Meteor Mash?
            - Focus Punch?
        - Strength:
            - Superpower?
            - Close Combat?
        - Fly:
            - Notes:
                - Is manual unlike the rest so would need to be added to the Fly edit
            - Teleport? (Would need to remove existing functionality)
            - ExtremeSpeed?
    - Expand moves usable in overworld (see above)
        - Alternatively, remove instances of trees, rocks, boulders, etc
        - Would need to double check but this should make Cut, Rock Smash, and Strength forgettable
            - (sHMMoves and IsMoveHm)
        - Trick House can still use them but maybe have Escape Rope usable there
    - Turn HMs into TMs if they are no longer used in the field
        - Remove them from being an option in the summary screen
        - Remove release blocks in pokemon_storage_system.c
        - Look for FIELD_MOVE_X
        - Currently are in same index spot. Should be moved to before HMs once everything is figured out (can simplify IsMoveHm once done)
        - Edit text (Steven's house for Dive for example)
    - When doing new savefile, remove `u32 tmShopFlags[4];` from include/global.h
    - Expand Bag!!! (https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/wiki/Make-the-Bag-Able-to-Hold-120-Items-Instead-of-30)
        - Medicine Pocket?
        - See if it's possible to give item PC and decoration PC have more room
    - Implement Pokedex Plus (https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=441996)
    - Figure out ?????? showing up at end of Dex
    - Revamp EVs to give 1 stat per EV and cap out at 63
    - Remove IVs? Maybe make binary for either 0 or 31 added to stat
        - Would need to figure out Hidden Power
    - Fire Blast/Hydro Pump/Stone Edge accurate in respective weathers?
        - Make Thunder also accurate in Electric Terrain?
    - Calculate Electro Ball more similarly to Gyro Ball?
    - DON'T USE DEBUG MENU FOR FLYING. Test to see if without it, Fly Flags are set correctly
        - Maybe use makeshift version of it (without setting all flags) to Fly without needing a Pokemon who knows it
    - Add in Houndoom for more Magma variety?
        - Replace Magcargo as Tabitha's main Pokemon (currently unsure if it will Mega Evolve)
            - Replace Mossdeep Maxie's Mightyena for Magcargo
        - Add in Hoenn Dex after Rhyperior
        - Move Houndoomite from Battle Frontier to Lilycove Shop
        - Update some grunts to have it 
            - Slugma/Vulpix Mossdeep grunt has Slugma replaced by Houndour, the Mightyena grunt gets replaced with a Magcargo, and one of the Numel grunts gets Mightyena
        - Update some Flannery trainers
        - Update some Kindlers
        - pokemon.c HOENN_TO_NATIONAL and whatnot
        - Put it in Safari Zone but remove encounters for new sections
            - Move Hoothoot to only Area 6 to take Houndour's place. This will give 5 and 6 six land Pokemon each. Redo encounter rates
    - Make list of all Magma/Aqua Pokemon and make them spread more evenly across the Grunts
        - Maybe Admins rely less on Mightyena/Leaders' signature
    - Add in Hoenn Dex regionals?
        - Sun/Shiny Stone for Alolan Raichu
        - Alolan Sandshrew/Vulpix at Shoal Cave
        - Alolan Muk
        - Shiny/Dawn Stone for Galarian Weezing
        - Cursola
        - Obstagoon
        - Hisui Voltorb
        - Post-game:
            - Alolan Meowth
            - Galarian Meowth
            - Paldean Wooper
        - Update level up/learnable movesets for them
        - Sandslash, Ninetales, Cursola, and maybe Obstagoon can be used to diversify the Elite Four teams
    - Add Farigiraf to Hoenn Dex once implemented
    - Add 3 other Regis?
        - Add Regigigas to Sealed Chamber?
        - Regieleki near New Mauville?
        - Regidrago near Meteor Falls?
    - Diversify water routes instead of just Tentacool/Wingull (definitely add more Carvanha; bring some fishing encounters to Surf)
    - Rework land_mons to only have 10 slots? (last two would go from 4->5)?
    - Spruce up battles/rematches
        - customAll Pokemon
            - Winston could have a shiny
                - Maybe all Rich Boys/Ladies have shinies (would need to have different Pokemon from each other instead of all having Zigzagoon)
            - Calvin could have a good Nature/EV
            - Leaders would have optimal Abilities/EVs/IVs/Natures
        - Winston's rich enough to buy TMs so his moveset should incorporate that once TMs are finalized
            - Gym Leader rematches should also utilize TMs
        - Breeders should have good IVs/Natures/Abilities
        - Triathlete would be Speed-focused (maybe endurance/HP too)
        - Winstrates (including Victor) should have EVs due to the mom mentioning using the Macho Brace
        - Tori and Tia should have Spindas that aren't identical
        - Fix Roxanne's rematches being male (due to double battles (which the rematches are) having the personality set before the gender. Can rearrange steps or use customAll to manually set gender)
        - Fix Flannery's rematches being male; also her Torkoal or Ninetales should have Drought
        - Norman can have Toxic Orb Toxic Boost Zangoose
            - Spinda: Thrash if Own Tempo, Superpower if Contrary. Should be given a cool pattern (maybe 88888888?)
        - Fix Winona's rematches being male; Pelipper gets Drizzle?
        - Gym leaders/Steven/Breeders can have Hidden Abilities
        - Maxie/Archie/Steven use Mega Evolutions
        - Aqua Leaders' signatures hold Deep Sea items (need to find equivalent for Magma)
        - Vito can use TMs
            - Swap Vito with Ace Trainer on 1F near the end?
    - Figure out why PokeNav callers think there were 512 wins at the Battle Palace
        - Might be related to Battle Tent giving an item right away
    - Check that Mossdeep swimmer flag works
    - Make all moves set to their Max PP automatically?
        - Would need to remove all PP Ups/Maxes
    - Bring important Trainers up to ORAS levels?
    - Magmortar Flash Fire?
    - Edit max money
    - Brendan/May rematches?
    - Make seperate Dex for post-game (similar to SwSh DLC dexes)?
