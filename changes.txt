In college, I had you list some of your favorite Pokémon and told you I'd make you a FireRed hack. It never happened, but now hacking has come a long way, although with Emerald getting the improvements. There are some challenges this provides due to it having more of a plot, but I think I made it work.









- Some reversions back to R/S
    - Birch is chased by a Poochyena
    - Some trainers on Routes 104 and 117 go back to their original locations
- Pokémon have a more even encounter distribution
- Fly, Flash, and Dive can now be forgotten
- Fly can be used if a Pokémon can learn it, without actually needing to be taught it.
- Fly can now be used after getting Mauville's badge
- Cut trees have been removed from everywhere but the Trick House
- Brick Break can now also break rocks in the overworld
- Sealed Chamber still needs to be completed to open the Regi areas, but it's solved by simply pressing A in the inner room. The door to Sealed Chamber and the Regis' inner rooms are now automatically open
- Made rapids easier to navigate so that only one trip is needed to get all items/battle all trainers (at the cost of looking slightly worse)
- All moves automatically have their max PP amount
- Sacred Ash now works in battles although it only revives one Pokémon
- Pokémon that evolve with an item at day or night now can evolve at any time
- EVs now give one stat increase for every EV but cap out at 63 (individual)/127 (total)

Pokémon:
    ALL:
        Movesets a combination of Gens 7-9
            Typically this means they have their latest moveset plus most moves from their Gen 7 moveset that have been removed
