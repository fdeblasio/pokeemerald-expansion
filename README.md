### [Documentation on features can be found here](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/wiki)

## If I already have a project based on regular pokeemerald, can I use pokeemerald-expansion?
Yes! Keep in mind that we keep up with pret's documentation of pokeemerald, which means that if your project a bit old, you might get merge conflicts that you need to solve manually.
- If you haven't set up a remote, run the command `git remote add RHH https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion`.
- Once you have your remote set up, run the command `git pull RHH master`.

With this, you'll get the latest version of pokeemerald-expansion, plus a couple of bugfixes that haven't been released into the next patch version :)

## **How do I update my version of pokeemerald-expansion?**
- If you haven't set up a remote, run the command `git remote add RHH https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion`.
- Once you have your remote set up, run the command `git pull RHH expansion/1.6.2`.
