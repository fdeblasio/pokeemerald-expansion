## To Do
- https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=416647&page=1
- https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/wiki/Tutorials
- Look at new animations for moves (in battle.h)
- Change Day/Night hours?
    - Set proper time hours (instead of all AM being morning and all PM being night)
- Gallade Sharpness (maybe wait for master/upcoming update)
- Make Latios/Latias easier to catch/not roam?
    - Maybe get rid of roamers and add both Latis to the Island?
- Add Farigiraf to Hoenn Dex once implemented
- Spruce up battles/rematches
    - customAll Pokemon
        - Winston could have a shiny
        - Calvin could have a good Nature/EV
        - Leaders would have optimal Abilities/EVs/IVs/Natures
    - Winston's rich enough to buy TMs so his moveset should incorporate that once TMs are finalized
        - Gym Leader rematches should also utilize TMs
    - Breeders should have good IVs/Natures/Abilities
    - Triathlete would be Speed-focused (maybe endurance/HP too)
    - Winstrates (including Victor) should have EVs due to the mom mentioning using the Macho Brace
    - Tori and Tia should have Spindas that aren't identical
    - Fix Roxanne's rematches being male (due to double battles (which the rematches are) having the personality set before the gender. Can rearrange steps or use customAll to manually set gender)
    - Fix Flannery's rematches being male; also her Torkoal or Ninetales should have Drought
    - Norman can have Toxic Orb Toxic Boost Zangoose
        - Spinda: Thrash if Own Tempo, Superpower if Contrary. Should be given a cool pattern (maybe 88888888?)
    - Fix Winona's rematches being male; Pelipper gets Drizzle
    - Gym leaders/Steven/Breeders can have Hidden Abilities
- Overworld sprites to match trainer sprites (for example, giving Youngsters yellow shirts, girl tubers a yellow tube, and Rangers red clothes)
- Expand bag
- Try to find Bolts foreground of Walda PC
- Implement Mega Evolution
    - Maxie/Archie teams
    - Primal legendaries in story (holding their orbs)
- Maybe all Rich Boys/Ladies have shinies (would need to have different Pokemon from each other instead of all having Zigzagoon)
- Some MAN_2's maybe could be switched to DEVON_EMPLOYEE
- Improve fishing?
- Debug menu improvements
- Stay on EVs/IVs when switching Pokemon
- Battle Tent Pokemon/EVs?
- Add Regigigas to Sealed Chamber?
- Update other punches (Shadow/Dizzy/Needle Arm) to 75 BP?
- Remove level up moves that are duplicated at level 1 (level takes priority over like level 5, but evolution moves take priority over level 1)
- Edit friendship evolution methods
- Calculate Electro Ball more similarly to Gyro Ball?
- Get all the weird Mauville men at once?
- Update Favor Lady's items to include new items
- Wild Beldum in Victory Road or something
    - Altering Cave: starters + Beldum?
- See if only some bag pockets can show up during battle (Key Items aren't needed in battle, for example)
- Figure out if it's possible to select multiple Pokemon when moving to or from party
- Implement Deoxys encounter at island/changing forms at Fallarbor
- Replace Regis with their doll sprites since they look more like them?
- Give Espeon Power Gem on level up or evolution
- Edit Slot odds (SLOT_MACHINE_)? Even though there's only three prizes?
- Make the rapids easier to navigate?
- Update Deep Sea items to work on respective evolutions as well?
- Add Hyper Training
- Edit moves that work in field
    - Maybe edit so instead of "if has move" to "if can learn move" (might not be simple since it's .inc and not C)
    - Cut:
        - Slash?
        - Fury Swipes?
        - Crush Claw?
        - Dragon Claw?
        - X-Scissor
    - Rock Smash:
        - Brick Break
        - Meteor Mash?
        - Focus Punch?
    - Strength:
        - Superpower?
        - Close Combat?
    - Fly:
        - Notes:
            - Is manual unlike the rest so would need to be added to the Fly edit
        - Teleport? (Would need to remove existing functionality)
        - ExtremeSpeed?
    - Flash:
        - Notes:
            - Is manual unlike the rest so would need to be added to the Fly edit
            - Maybe make a list instead of a bunch of ||s
            - Make the menu say "Light" or something instead?
        - Dazzling Gleam
        - Morning Sun
        - Moonlight
        - Tail Glow
        - Luster Purge
        - Power Gem?
        - Flash Cannon?
        - Signal Beam?
        - Spotlight?
        - Lumina Crash?
        - Reflect?
        - Light Screen?
        - Abilities like Illuminate?
- Rework land_mons to only have 10 slots? (last two would go from 4->5)?
- Once Mints are implemented, in Lilycove 3F, move X items to left clerk and make right clerk Mints
    - Or move Mints to left too and have left be Chansey, right be Delibird
- Add Snowscape to Snorunt line's level up set once upcoming is merged in
- Remove Alolan Raichu?/Add in other Hoenn Dex regionals? (Alolan Sandshrew/Vulpix at Shoal Cave, Shiny/Dawn Stone for Galarian Weezing)


- Maybe do one run-through of small updates and then add in new items/updated teams in a second runthrough?
    - When doing new savefile, remove `u32 tmShopFlags[4];` from include/global.h
    - Maybe this is when the bag expansion happens
    - Implement Pokedex Plus (https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=441996)
    - Figure out ?????? showing up at end of Dex
    - Revamp EVs to give 1 stat per EV and cap out at 63 (bring Vitamin price back up since less are needed?)
    - DON'T USE DEBUG MENU FOR FLYING. Test to see if without it, Fly Flags are set correctly
        - Maybe use makeshift version of it (without setting all flags) to Fly without needing a Pokemon who knows it
    - Expand moves usable in overworld (see above)
        - Alternatively, remove instances of trees, rocks, boulders, etc
        - Would need to double check but this should make Cut, Rock Smash, and Strength forgettable
    - Add in Houndoom for more Magma variety?
        - Replace Magcargo as Tabitha's main Pokemon (currently unsure if it will Mega Evolve)
        - Add in Hoenn Dex after Rhyperior
        - Add Houndoomite to Lilycove Shop
        - Update some grunts to have it

        - Update some Flannery trainers
        - Update some Kindlers
